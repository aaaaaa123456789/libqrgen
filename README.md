# QR generation library

This is just a little fun project I made, because spending three weekends understanding the QR specification makes far
more sense than spending three minutes understanding the GCC flags needed to compile the QR library that I already
had. It's certainly a lot more fun, at least.

Everything in this repo is released to the public domain under [the Unlicense](LICENSE). While I did take inspiration
from various sources across the internet (including the specification itself), I didn't use anybody else's code here,
so there's no copyright burden.

Check out the [documentation](extra/docs.md). There's also a little [test program](extra/qrtest.c) that takes
command-line arguments and outputs BMP data to standard output.
